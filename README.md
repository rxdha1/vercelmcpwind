# MCP for Vercel and v0.dev with advanced capabilites.

## About this MCP for Vercel and v0

Specifies Vercel as the deployment provider.
Enables v0.dev as a coding assistant for UI and code generation.
Allows for database provisioning (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Vercel’s own storage).
Optionally, provides authentication and environment variable management.

Vercel Integration: The deployment provider is set to Vercel. Fill in your actual projectId, teamId, and API token (these can be generated on your Vercel dashboard).
v0.dev Integration: The AI provider is v0.dev. You’ll need an API key from your v0.dev account.
Database Setup: The configuration provisions a PostgreSQL database using Vercel’s managed Postgres (or you can swap for MySQL, PlanetScale, etc.). The connection string is referenced via an environment variable.
Features: Flags to enable auto-deployment, AI code generation, and database provisioning.
Instructions: Human-readable steps for how the MCP should orchestrate the workflow.

Support multiple database types: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB, each with their own provider and environment variable for connection.
Add advanced configuration:
Secrets management for sensitive values (API keys, DB passwords, etc.).
Multi-environment support for development, staging, and production, allowing you to override environment variables and secrets per environment.
Flags to enable these features in the features section.
Provide clear placeholders and structure so you can easily fill in your actual credentials.
This configuration enables flexible deployment, secure secrets handling, and easy switching between environments.
